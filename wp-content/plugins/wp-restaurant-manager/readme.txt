== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are there any special requirements to use this plugin? =

Nope. The plugin only requires PHP 5.3+ to be installed on your server.

= How do i check if have PHP 5.3 on my host? =

Just download and install the plugin, upon activation, if your host is not running on PHP 5.2 the plugin will not activate and will display a message warning you that your host is running an extremely old version of PHP.

If your host is running PHP 5.2 or less, you are using a deprecated version of PHP not supported anymore by PHP itself, this also leaves you vulnerable to potential security issues.

= How can i upgrade to PHP 5.3 on my host? =

Contact your host and report them you want PHP 5.3, they should enable it for you at no additional cost, if they're honest ;)

= How do i use this plugin? =

Navigate to the plugin's settings page and read the documentation by clicking the "help" button into the top right corner of your screen.

= Do you have an online documentation? =

Yes. Check [the online documentation.](http://docs.themesdepot.org/collection/139-wp-restaurant-manager)

= Can i customize the templates files of the plugin? =

Yes. Check [the online documentation.](http://docs.themesdepot.org/collection/139-wp-restaurant-manager)

= Are there filters and actions available? =

Yes. Check [the online documentation.](http://docs.themesdepot.org/collection/139-wp-restaurant-manager)

= Does this plugin work with every WP theme available on earth? =

Testing a plugin with thousands of themes is obviously impossible. The plugin has been tested with the WordPress defaults themes, furthermore the plugin has been carefully developed to inject very little additional css and js only on the pages that are handled by the plugin to avoid conflicts with themes and plugins, this should be more than enough to have the plugin perfectly working.

It is also impossible to predict errors, due to the multitude of themes and plugins on each wp site. If you spot a bug with the plugin, feel free to report it. Support will only be provided for bugs within the plugin.

= Why my food menu looks weird? =

Each theme is coded with a specific set of rules that might interfere with the very small amount of css used by the plugin, if this is the case, since the plugin only adds a couple of css lines, you might want to contact the author of your theme who should be able to help you with.

= Is this plugin free? =

Yes.

= Then why do you have a premium version? =

Using the free plugin unfortunately does not entitle users to full-on support; that costs money to provide, if you value the plugin, and your site/business relies on it, purchasing a premium license helps covering support costs and gives you also more value for the plugin.

= Do you offer support? =
