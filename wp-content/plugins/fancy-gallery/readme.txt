Supercharged image gallery management tool with touch-enabled, responsive, mobile-friendly image lightbox for WordPress!


== Description ==
Gallery Manager is *the* most innovative state of the art **WordPress Gallery Management tool** which enables you to **organize image galleries** easily in your WordPress backend. Furthermore this gallery plugin adds a beautiful awesome **javascript lightbox effect** (touch-enabled, responsive, optimized for both, mobile and desktop, web browsers) to all links pointing to an image anywhere on your website. This includes images in your posts, galleries, pages, sidebar widgets and anywhere else on your website.

= Lightbox behavior =
All links pointing to an image will automatically opened in a **responsive lightbox**. You do not need to care about any tag attributes or link classes, the plugins takes care about that for you. When using the default [gallery] shortcode the images will get a **"previous", "next" and a slideshow button**. The gallery itself uses your themes gallery style and keeps your common identity untouched.

¹ Available in [Gallery Manager Pro](http://dennishoppe.de/en/wordpress-plugins/gallery-manager).<br>
² Your theme needs to support this too.

= Gallery shortcode =
Of course you can use "exclude" and "include" parameters in your [gallery] shortcode like you already know from the traditional gallery shortcode. The Gallery Manager plugin does not touch the mechanic of the default [gallery] shortcode.

= Settings =
You can find the settings page in your Dashboard -> Settings -> Galleries.

= Template files =
All plugin outputs can be changed via user defined HTML templates. Just put the templates you want to overwrite inside your theme folder (no matter if parent theme or child theme). You can find the default templates in the plugin folder in "templates/". You can find a list of the available template files in documentation of the pro version. *Please do not modify the original templates! You would lose all your modifications when updating the plugin!*

= Questions and support requests =
Please use the support forum on WordPress.org only for this free lite version of the plugin. For the pro version there is a separate support package available. *Please do not use the WordPress.org support forum for questions about the pro version* or questions about my services! Of course you can hire me for consulting, support, programming and customizations at any time.

= Language =
* This Plugin is available in English.
* Diese Erweiterung ist in Deutsch verfügbar. ([Ulrike Seddig](http://UlrikeSeddig.de/))

= Translate this plugin =
If you have translated this plugin in your language feel free to send us the language file (.po file) via E-Mail with your name and this translated sentence: "This plug-in is available in %YOUR_LANGUAGE_NAME%." We will add it to the plug-in.

You can find the *Translation.pot* file in the *language/* folder in the plugin directory.

* Copy it.
* Rename it (to your language code).
* Translate everything.
* Send it via E-Mail to &lt; Translation [@t] [DennisHoppe](http://DennisHoppe.de) [dot] de &gt;.
* Thats it. Thank you! =)

= Limitations of the lite version =
There are no real limitations in this version except the number of galleries you can organize within the gallery management tool. The maximal number of galleries is limited to three but of course you can use the traditional galleries in your posts and pages *without* any limitations!


== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 4.0 or greater
* PHP version 5.3 or greater
* MySQL version 5.0 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you do not need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Gallery Manager, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the plugins menu and click "Add New".

In the search field type "Gallery Manager" and click "Search plugins". Once you have found my gallery plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking "Install Now".

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading my gallery plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Upgrade Notice ==
If you update the plugin from version 1.5.x or lower to version 1.6.x or higher please reactivate the plugin after the update and re-save your options through clicking the "Save changes" button at the end of the options page.


== Other Notes ==

Gallery Manager is available as [premium plugin](http://dennishoppe.de/en/wordpress-plugins/gallery-manager) too. In the premium version you can use all options and features which are restricted in the lite version.

Possibly even more important, buying the premium edition gives you access to me and my support team. You can email us your questions about usage of the plugin or your problems in setting it up and we will assist you in no time!
